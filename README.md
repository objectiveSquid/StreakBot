# StreakBot ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘»
A minimal tool to keep your streaks on Snapchat, using python with selenium.

## Compatability (14. June 2024)
  - ### The user should have a graphical interface, since it uses selenium, and Snapchat usually serves a captcha on login.
### Tested (issues are welcome)
  - Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
### Untested, but probably functional
  - Most modern debian-like linux distributions
  - Modern windows versions (10/11)
